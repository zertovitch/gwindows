GWindows & GNAVI
================

The GWindows free and open-source Ada programming framework for MS Windows
is used for many years in professional, industrial, commercial, or open-source
applications. GWindows is in pure Ada, has no dependencies other than the Windows
API itself that is available on every PC running Windows.
GWindows is updated regularly.

The GNAVI application is an integrated, interactive visual development
environment. That software (GNAVI) is so far unfinished.

For graphical interface development, an alternative to GNAVI is
the combination of a resource editor (for instance the freeware ResEdit,
shipped with GWindows installtion) for editing resource scripts (.rc files),
and GWenerator, a code generator that translates a .rc file into Ada files
that use GWindows.

For more information, read the other "readme"'s, mainly:

  gwindows\readme.txt              -  for the GWindows framework
  gwenerator\gwenerator_info.html  -  for the GWenerator code generator
  gnatcom\readme.txt               -  for the GNATCOM framework

But if you are in a hurry, jump to one of the following project files
and start playing!

  gwindows\gwindows_tutorials.gpr  (executables are created in gwindows\tutorials\)
  gwindows\gwindows_samples.gpr    (executables are created in gwindows\samples\)
  gwindows\gwindows_contrib.gpr    (executables are created in gwindows\contrib\)
  gwindows\gwindows_test.gpr       (executables are created in gwindows\test\)
