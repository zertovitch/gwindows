Abstract
========

GWindows is a full Microsoft Windows Rapid Application Development
framework for programming GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) with Ada.
The framework includes ADO database and Active X support.

Status
======

GWindows is successfuly being used by individuals and companies
world wide for the development of professional Windows (32 and 64 bit)
products.

There are also open-source projects using GWindows, for instance:
  AZip   -  a free, portable Zip Archive Manager -
               https://azip.sourceforge.io/
  LEA    -  a Lightweight Editor for Ada -
               https://l-e-a.sourceforge.io
  TeXCAD -  a program for drawing or retouching {picture}s in LaTeX -
               https://texcad.sourceforge.io/

Please joint the e-mail list
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnavi/lists/gnavi-discuss
if you are experiencing any problems or have suggestions for improvements.

Documentation
=============

In the "docs" directory there is a user guide in Word format
(HTML available as well), and a quick reference text.

Installation
============

GWindows doesn't require any installation beyond getting a local copy of
the GWindows and GNATCOM frameworks' Ada sources.
This task is facilitated by the setup program (e.g. GWindows 30-Aug-2018.exe
downloaded from there: http://sf.net/projects/gnavi/files/latest/download ) which
unpacks a copy of the GWindows and GNATCOM frameworks with samples, tutorials,
tests, third-party contributions, and other goodies.

Alternatively, you can retrieve the most recent copy of the SVN
repository from http://sf.net/p/gnavi/code/ .

So, normally, if you read this readme.txt document, installation already happened!
The setup program offers you to choose either the ANSI or Unicode variant of
GWindows. You can change that choice any time by running, in the gwindows folder,
ansi.cmd or unicode.cmd. You can also install GWindows at one, two or more places.
