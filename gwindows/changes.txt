Changes Since 1.2
=================

----------------
General Changes:
----------------

The directory bindings has been renamed framework to reflect its expanded nature


-------------
New Features:
-------------

Added to GWindows.Base - Set_Standard_Font

Added create method to GWindows.Panels.Panel_Type

Added additional string handling packages under GWindows.GStrings

Added to GWindows.Cursors Start_Wait_Cursor and End_Wait_Cursor

Added to GWindows.Windows.Window_Type write only properties:
      Default_Cursor
      Default_System_Cursor

Added procedure Activate to GWindows.Windows.MDI.MDI_Child_Window_Type to
      allow for child window to activate itself with its parent

You can now set the icons of windows from a GWindows.Drawing_Objects.Icon_Type

Dock_Children is now called after On_Create is fired for all creation methods
      of GWindows.Windows it is also called in an on_size regardless if an
      on_size handler is set or not

The MDI_Child_Window of an MDI_Top_Window now by default has the Dock property
set to Fill and can now be changed to any other dock position

Now GWindows.GControls exists as the base class for GWindows based controls
      implemented completely in GWindows and not based in Win32 controls,
      common controls, or custom controls.

Added GWindows.GControls.Size_Bars that can be docked on to the sides of
      windows and panels and will automaticly resize their parent control
      when dragged with the mouse allowing for easy creation of splitters,
      trays, etc.
      See the new example samples\simple\splitters.adb

Packing Boxes insets can now be set as individual properties

Added Run_Mode to windows so that a window or control knows if it is in
the various processes of development in GNAVI or in a normal running
environment.

Added Angle to Create_Font to allow for creating fonts at 10ths of a
degree from base

Added ability to retrieve font metrics of font selected in to canvas

Added Background Color type to GWindows.Window_Type

Added ability to add custom data to any window or control with the custom_data
property

Packing boxes can now auto resize to their contents. Additional hooks were
added to automaticly pack child packing_boxes when packing_boxes are resized
or when ever the parent windows Dock_Children is called.

----------
Bug Fixes:
----------

Fixed problem with Packing Boxes enumerating children of children and
as such preventing the nesting of packing boxes.

Listboxes scroll bars not showing when list expanded

Fix to MDI child windows not setting menu until receiving an MDI_Activate
event.

Fixed panels - when set to raised was drawing a sunken border

Fixed - Rich Edit Boxes require preloading the riched20.dll. This is done in
the body of GWindows.Edit_Boxes.Rich, so a pragma has been added to insure
the elaboration of the body will take place before attempts will be made to
use the control

Fixed - Register_Class did nothing, now properly registers a Win32 class

Added CClass to MDI create procedures

Various changes for compilation under GNAT 5

Fixed - Doing a Get_Font on a window caused that window's internal font to
      be deleted when the received font went out of scope.
