## AFLEX

Ada Lexical Analyser Generator

## BUILD

     - get aflex from http://sourceforge.net/projects/p2ada
     - go to aflex directory
     - run "gnatmake aflex"
     - move the executable in a reachable directory

## USAGE

$ aflex file.l

Generated files file_io.a file_dfa.a file.a
Use .a files in GNAT with gnatchop

## OPTIONS

  -v  dump statistics
  -d  make a "debug" scanner
  -T  trace processing
  -s  suppress the default rule
  -I  generate an interactive scanner
  -i  generate a case-insensitive scanner
  -ce use equivalence classes
  -cf flag don't compress the DFA state table
  -cm flag use meta-equivalence classes
  -L  doesn't generate #line directives
  -p  generate a report relating to scanner performance
  -b  generate "lex.backtrack" file listing backtracking states
  -E  indicate whether or not the aflex generated codes will be used by Ayacc extension.
      Ayacc extension has more power in error recovery.
  -x  prefix all: prefix function YYLex: [BASENAME]_YYLex
      (packages [BASENAME]_IO and [BASENAME]_DFA already are by default).
      It allows using multiple parsers in the same main procedure.
      See equivalant Prefix_All option in AYACC.
      This allows using several parsers in the same main project.
