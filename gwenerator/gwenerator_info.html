<b>GWenerator</b> is a code generator that translates a
Resource Compiler script file (.rc or .dlg)
into an Ada package for the GWindows GUI system.<br>
This tool comes in two "flavours":
 <ul>
  <li> A graphical, user-friendly version, <b>GWenerator.exe</b>
  <li> A command-line version, <b>rc2gw.exe</b>
 </ul>
&nbsp;<br>
GWenerator doesn't pretend to be the ultimate tool, but is rather
there to fill the gap between visual GUI design
and the wonderful GWindows programming framework.
Fortunately, there is a way, though not perfect, nor complete,
nor interactive, to
separate the GUI design and the code generation.
This way is the Resource! There are many Resource Editors
for Windows, for more than 27 years (in 2016). It ranges from
the antique DlgEdit to Visual Studio 2015 for the editors provided
by Microsoft. In the freeware or open-source world, there are
also some, e.g. ResEdit. What was missing, to benefit 
from that source
of GUI design, was a parser for the resource script files.
It is precisely around such a parser that GWenerator
is built.
<p>
GWenerator translates those resources that
are meaningful to be translated, that is:
 <ul>
  <li> dialogs
  <li> menus
  </ul>&nbsp;<br>

Typically, a resource like <b>XYZ.rc</b> will be translated into  
<b>XYZ_Resource_GUI</b> Ada package (.ads and .adb), that can be "with"-ed
from your application, for instance <b>XYZ.adb</b>. Note that the
graphical interface of the tool is build through the tool itself!
It means that looking at <b>GWenerator.rc</b> and the
<b>GWenerator_Resource_GUI</b> gives you a good example of what are
the inputs and outputs.

<p>  
The advantage of having a tool like GWenerator instead of
using the resource items directly
is that once these resources are as GWindows code,
they can be transformed dynamically (e.g. status of dialog items, recent
file list menus), and benefit from the high-level, object-oriented, safe, and easy to program
framework of GWindows. Edit box contents can be set or read without
needing interfacing C strings. You can program within the GWindows
type system.
You don't need to mix GWindows with tricky, low-level Win32 elements as when you are using
the resources directly.<br>
It is also perfectly possible to mix
dialogs or menus from the GWenerator tool and other GWindows elements which have been
programmed in a "non-visual" way. 
After all, the compiler cannot distinguish what is automatically generated and what is typed by hand.

<p> Eventually, parts of the generated code
can be reused for more profound transformation or automation, 
but in most cases the link [graphic edition &rarr; automatic code generation]
would be better to be kept. For dynamically adding dialog items, better to use the inheritance
from the generated object types.
</p>

 <ul>
 <li><b>GWenerator projects ("GWen's")</b>.<br>
     A project serves as to memorize the name of a resource script file (<tt>.rc</tt>)
     as well as transcription options. Additionally, you can designate a main
     Ada application (source or exe). All this information is stored into a project file
     with the <tt>.gwen</tt> extension.
	 If you are using the <tt>rc2gw</tt> command-line tool instead, you can reproduce
	 all the options of the project file with command-line options.
 <li><b>Create a new project</b><br>
     When you start the GWenerator or decide to begin a
     new project with the "File/New" menu entry,
     select "Options/Options for this GWen"
     and set a resource script file name (red box below).
     You can also choose the file with the "<b>Browse...</b>" button,
     and may want to remove absolute path after that.
     <img align=right width=515 height=473 alt="GWen options" src="img/gwen_options.png">
     If you check the "<b>Listen for newer version</b>" option, GWenerator will monitor
     new saves of the resource script and detect when the script is newer than
     the generated Ada code.
     If you check the "<b>Automatically translate when newer</b>" option, GWenerator
     will also launch a new translation of the script into Ada code when it
     detects that the script is newer.
 <li><b>Start a translation</b><br>
     When you press the "<b>Translate now</b>" button, a translation occurs and details
     appear in the box below as long as you have checked the "<b>Show details</b>" option.
     The translation also occurs automatically via the mechanism described above.<br>
     <img align=top width=354 height=451 alt="GWenerator running" src="img/trans.png">
 <li><b>Ada background build</b><br>
     If the "Automatically build when GUI newer" check box is selected in the "GWen"
     project options, the tool will rebuild your application
     automatically whenever the generated Ada sources are newer than the executable (or any object file)
     you have specified. The same occurs on demand when you press the "Build now" button in the
     right part of the user interface. The right part is shown when you check
     the "<b>Show Ada build</b>" option (cf red oval in the picture here).

 <b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">How to build the tool itself (obtain the executables of rc2gw or GWenerator):
 </font></b></a>
 <p>
You need an Ada compiler (Ada 95 or more) that compiles for Windows 32 bit. 
Only GNAT has been tested with GWindows, but probably any will fit.
 <p>
If you have GNAT installed, go to the "<b>src</b>" sub-directory and 
start "<b>make.cmd</b>". 
Then, the <b>GWenerator.exe</b> is built, as well as the command-line version, <b>rc2gw.exe</b>.
<p>
For programming with the tool, you may want an installation 
of the GWindows system, although a full one
is included in the RC2GW package (built for ANSI, i.e.
8 bit character applications).
<p>
If you want to <b>modify</b> the tool, you may need to modify the RC.l and RC.y files,
especially if you want to expand the grammar for new resource styles, options
or whatever (the possible combinations are huge!).
In that case, you also need to build "ayacc.exe" (via: "gnatmake ayacc.adb")
and "aflex.exe" (via: "gnatmake aflex.adb") which are
in the "ayacc95" and "aflex95" sub-directories.
These executable have to be put into a directory callable from the PATH
or directly into the "src" sub-directory along with the RC.l and RC.y files.
Then, "make -r" recreates some Ada sources from the RC.l and RC.y files
and builds rc2gw.exe using these new sources.
If you are confused by these generators of code generators,
you can also submit .rc files (or fragments) to the project coordinators
and hope they will do something good with it...

<li>
 <a name=demo></a>
 <b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">How to build the demo / test applications:
 </font></b></a>
 <p>
Go to the "<b>test</b>" sub-directory and start "<b>make_all.cmd</b>".
For each name mentioned in "make_all.cmd",
you will get first a code generation for a resource (.rc) file.
<br>
For instance
<b>GW_RE_App.rc</b> will give a <b>GW_RE_App_Resource_GUI</b> Ada package (.ads and .adb).
Then an application will be built (GW_RE_App.exe). 
<br>
There are several resources tested:
<ul>
<li> <b>GW_RE_App.rc</b> is created with <a href=#resources>ResEdit</a>; there is a demo application with the same name
<li> <b>VS_2008.rc</b> is created with Visual Studio 2008; there is a demo
     application with the same name; we choose to translate it with the "one package per item" option
<li> <b>TeXCAD.rc</b>, only to test parsing; no demo
<li> <b>AdaGIDE.rc</b>, only to test parsing; no demo
<li> <b>Web??.rc</b>, resources downloaded from Internet by "googling" keywords
</ul>
Additionally, you can look at <b>GWenerator.rc</b> in the tool's source directory (src),
which is created with <a href=#resources>ResEdit</a>. The application there is functional.

    <b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">Annex 1: Configuring ResEdit for GNAT (Windows)</font></b>
  </a>
  <p>
    Upon the first start of ResEdit, you may get the following message:<br><br>
      <img align=top border=1 width=483 height=179 alt="Message" src="img/re_01.png">
    <br><br>
    This means ResEdit has no access to files such as "windows.h", that are needed.<br>
    Just say "No". Then, go to Preferences,<br><br>
      <img align=top border=1 width=331 height=93 alt="Preferences" src="img/re_02.png">
    <br><br>
    then, General &rarr; Include paths:<br><br>
      <img align=top border=1 width=624 height=462 alt="Include paths" src="img/re_03.png">
    <br><br>
    We assume here that GNAT is installed in the directory "C:\GNAT\2021" (2021 is just an example and
    the directory is rather C:\GNATPRO for GNAT Pro).<br>
    Then the include directory required for ResEdit will be "C:\GNAT\2021\x86_64-pc-mingw32\include".
    You can see the actual GNAT directory in the PATH (command "path" in the command-line interface, cmd.exe).
    <br><br>
    Note that this configuration point is automatically performed by the GWindows installer:
    it scans the PATH for GNAT installations and searches for possible include paths.
    A new ResEdit.xml configuration file is created with the correct path(s).<br>
  </p>
    <b><font face="Arial, Tahoma">Advices about using ResEdit</font></b>
  <p>
    <ol>
    <li>It is recommended to have a proper naming convention for the ".h" files containing the resource constants.<br>
    It may be especially useful if you have several resource scripts in the same location.<br>
    For instance the interface with "GWenerator.rc" has "GWenerator.h" instead of the default "resource.h".<br>
    To that aim, in the preferences, put <b>"%barefilename%.h"</b> instead of "resource.h" as Header file name.
    <br><br>
    Note that this configuration point is also done for you by the GWindows installer.<br><br>
      <img align=top border=1 width=624 height=459 alt="Header file name" src="img/re_04.png">
    <br> <br>
    <li>Sometimes, the auto-resize feature of ResEdit is too narrow and the last word of some labels are cut out
    when rendered by GWindows. The solution is to switch off the auto-resize feature:<br>
    Preferences &rarr; Dialog Editor &rarr; Control preferences &rarr; Auto resize controls: Never.

    The following are observations with Visual Studio Community 2015, for Win32 C++ projects.
    This is a way to design user interfaces for GWindows. Just ignore the ".cpp" and many other files, they do nothing.
    <ul>
      <li>
        As the GWenerator understands (so far) only 8-bit characters, you need VS to write the ".rc" and ".h" files with this encoding.
        In the project properties, choose "Configuration Properties" &rarr; "General" &rarr; "Character Set" &rarr; "No Set".<br>
        You may need to convert (once) the ".rc" and ".h" files to 8-bit (ANSI) encoding, for instance via Notepad++.<br>
        Then VS remembers the encoding choice.
      <li>
        It is recommended to have a proper naming convention for the ".h" file
        containing the resource constants instead of the default "resource.h" (same remark as for ResEdit).<br>
        In the Resource View, right-click on the resource name, choose "Resource Includes..." and use a proper name.
